# Neuromatch Academy 2021

Inspired by the group project I worked on during Neuromatch Academy, I took the time to re-visit and re-analyze data provided by Steinmetz et. al.

My detailed analysis can be accessed in the **"NMA2021_Project" notebook**.

Based on group project by Anna-Lena Schlenner, Shira Lupkin, Katrina Lee Bartas and Joaquin Herrero

See "Presentation_NMA2021" for the final results of the group project.
